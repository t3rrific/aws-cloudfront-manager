# Limitations

## Manual vs Automatic CDN Cache Clear

The extension focuses on *manually* clearing CDN caches. If you require automated ways to clear CloudFront caches, for example on page or content updates, feel free to [contact me](https://schams.net) to discuss options.

## Access Restriction on a Per-Module Basis

The access to the function is controlled on a *per-module* basis and not on a *per-record* basis. This means that you **can not** restrict access to certain CloudFront distributions for specific backend users. You can, however, restrict the access to the backend module for certain user groups.

If you require this function, you can submit a *feature request* at [GitHub](https://github.com/typo3-on-aws/aws-cloudfront-manager) and consider sponsoring it. You can also [contact me](https://schams.net) to discuss your exact requirements.
