# Introduction

## About the TYPO3 Extension

This TYPO3 extension provides a simple way for backend users to clear the CDN cache of [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) distributions.

The CloudFront distributions and cache paths are pre-defined by system maintainers (administrators) to minimize user errors. Backend users with the appropriate access permissions (including editors) can open the backend module and execute a cache-clear command (*cache invalidation*) by a click of a button.

The extension also lets backend users retrieve the most important details of the CloudFront distributions. This includes their distribution IDs, domain names, deployment statuses, last modification date/times, etc.

## Main Features

- Easy to install, easy to configure, easy to use.
- Manage one or multiple CloudFront distributions.
- Minimize potential user errors (e.g. wrong URI paths).
- Access on a per-user and/or per-group basis using TYPO3's secure user permissions concept.
- TYPO3 caches some data by default to achieve outstanding performance.
- Multi-language support (no hard-coded labels).
